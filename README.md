# VM4IE8
A simple vue-like library which supports IE8.

## What is this?

This is a very simple implementation of vue@1.0.0, which is created during I'm learning the source code of vue. It has Observer, Dep, 
Directive, Watcher, Batcher, which is the same as vue. This library is derived from this repository, [https://github.com/DMQ/mvvm](https://github.com/DMQ/mvvm).
I rewrite it, so it is more like vue.

Significantly, it supports IE8. Yes, you can use reactive two-way data binding on IE8.

This is a library for learning vue, so DONOT use it in your production environment.

## Supported Features
- reactive two-way data binding.
- computed property.
- directives: v-text, v-html, v-model, v-show, v-bind, v-on.
- IE8 supported.
